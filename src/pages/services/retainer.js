            to deliver work on a daily basis. Instead, you pay a fixed amount each month and
            can reach out to me as little or as often as you want.`}

            you and your business a little. Assuming that I agree that I am able to support you and that the retainer
            approach is the best fit for you, then I will send out a contract for you to sign and your first invoice will
            be due. Once this contract has been signed and the invoice paid, I will arrange one or more calls to go
            a little deeper into the areas that I might be able to help you. I will take this time to learn more about your
            business, products and technical strategy, so that I can identify how best to help support your business. Given
            this phase will take a little time, I will offer a grace period to cover this "getting to know you" part before
            your first retainer period comes into effect. Beyond this, I will continue to keep in touch whilst the retainer
            is active, so that I can keep up to date on how your business is going and any developments that would be
            useful for me to be aware of. Each ${service.mainCharge.unit} a new invoice will be sent, and once paid, we
            will roll onto the next period of the retainer. The retainer will remain active for as long as you need or want
            my support.`}
