# Managing Docker Logs with ELK and Fluentd
Recently, I have begun working with a new client to deliver technical content. This content aims to cover different areas and delves into a deep technical level. Some of the work has been based on knowledge I already have, while the rest has required some quantity of research and experimentation.


The first such article has recently been published by the client! So it is great to be able to share this. The article covers basic and advanced solutions to working with logging through Docker. It leverages the power of the Elastic Stack coupled with Fluentd, and walks through some of the possible, more distributed, solutions that an individual or company may wish to utilise.


Head over to the Coralogix website and have a read:
